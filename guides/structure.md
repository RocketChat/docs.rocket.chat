# Structure

Documentation should be organized into the following top level folders/categories:

- **User**: how to use
- **Administration**: how to administer
- **Installation**: how to install
- **Developer**: how to contribute as a developer
- **Changelog**: a log of version changes
- **Support**: how to get support
- **Contributing:** general contribution guide

**Note**: For some projects **Developer** will link to generated API documentation.

Take a look at the [Rocket.Chat Server Documentation](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat.Docs) for an example of this structure in action.

## Grouping or Nesting Topics

Group documentation in each category into topic or feature folders. Avoid further nesting in topic/feature folders.

## Screenshots and Images

As much as possible try to write documentation without using screenshots. Updating screenshots is an extremely time consuming erroneous process. Images also increase the repository size.

Reusing a handful of reference screenshots for all articles is acceptable.

General figures and images that don't need to be updated with each new version is also acceptable.
