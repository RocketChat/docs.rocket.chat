Work in progress: needs tutorial.

We have many projects at Rocket.Chat, from the Meteor server web application to out various packaging scripts, APIs and client applications. Pick a project that you care about or want to carve a piece of ownership in.

In the coming weeks we will add missing/outdated article lists and reference articles to each project to make it easier for you to get started.

To find out how documentation should ideally be structured in each Rocket.Chat project take a look at the [structure guide](/guides/structure/) and for styling take a look at the [style guide](/guides/style/).
