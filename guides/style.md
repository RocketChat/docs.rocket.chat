# Style

Rocket.Chat projects use a variety of Static Site Generators to generate documentation but all the articles are written in Markdown.

## Markdown

We use [GitHub Flavoured Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to write our content.

Avoid using HTML in articles, the exception is to embed external content (iFrames, JavaScript).

## APIs

Work in progress: needs more detail.

Each project uses a documentation tool relevant to the programming language or framework to generate its API documentation.
